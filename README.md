# Configurable WakaTime plugin for chrome

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the plugin.

## Installation

Go to `chrome://extensions/`
Enable developer mode, and load extension from root of `wakatime-chrome-parcel` repo.

## Config

You can find information on how to configure your app in example.config.json.

I'm too lazy now to write full configuration of plugin.
